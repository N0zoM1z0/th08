# Current reconstruction handoff

Use this page for the current phase and next task. Detailed runtime results are
in [Replay validation results](REPLAY_RESULTS.md); dated investigation notes
are in [RE_HANDOFF_HISTORY.md](RE_HANDOFF_HISTORY.md).

## Current status

The target is the original Japanese TH08 1.00d executable, size 840,704 bytes,
SHA-256 `330fbdbf58a710829d65277b4f312cfbb38d5448b3df523e79350b879213d924`.

Authored source covers 1,107 / 1,107 functions; the accepted exact ledger covers
1,106 / 1,107. The sole authored near match remains
`ReplayManager::PlaybackExtendedInputAndFps @ 0x004526C0`. Read live figures
from the ledgers:

```bash
python3 scripts/analysis/report-reconstruction-status.py --summary
```

Whole-executable layout and target-linked library recovery remain in progress.
The native VC7 `normal` build serves exact comparisons; `bugfix` serves runtime
testing. The Windows i386 prerequisite is complete. Modern Windows packaging
and macOS runtime work have their own platform guides.

## Completed replay validation

The native VC7, Linux x86_64, and Linux i386 products each pass all 108 credited
recordings and 12,311,460 calculations. All 25 fields, recorded stage-end
scores, natural replay exits, and published fingerprints agree with retail.
The native gate used fresh cold builds and fresh paired captures. Both portable
gates launched isolated processes and reused validated retail references.
Retained-evidence verification also passes for all three products.

The native changes are merged in
[PR #26](https://github.com/N0zoM1z0/th08/pull/26). The portable branch includes
those repairs through [PR #27](https://github.com/N0zoM1z0/th08/pull/27) and the
renderer, precision, and replay-tooling changes through
[PR #28](https://github.com/N0zoM1z0/th08/pull/28). Portable gameplay source
checkpoint `af9cb1d3` retains all 1,106 accepted VC7 units after a cold build,
with fresh normal/bugfix links and owner/data/callee checks.

The native ordinary-paced, rasterized demo gate passes all three demos:
16,080 frames and all 22 fields. Portable checks include four retail frames,
four renderer contract groups, actual HOME screenshots in both display modes,
six bounded replay/render windows, focused GDB controls, and sanitizer smoke
and Stage 5 audits. The results page records each check's scope and artifacts.

Use [REPLAY_TESTING.md](REPLAY_TESTING.md) for native reproduction and the
[portable replay guide](https://github.com/N0zoM1z0/th08/blob/port/portable-64bit/docs/PORTABLE_REPLAY_TESTING.md)
for Linux reproduction and `--verify-only`. Generated evidence stays under
`build/`; credited recordings, provenance, and published expectations are
committed.

## Remaining runtime evidence

Small portable pixel differences and nine unconfirmed Stage 5 color suspects
remain in the
[rendering report](https://github.com/N0zoM1z0/th08/blob/port/portable-64bit/docs/PORTABLE_RENDERING.md).
The color observations are heuristic; same-frame review found no obvious
anomaly in the initial sample. Native
[RT-007](RUNTIME_ISSUES.md#rt-007) still needs the reported visual interaction
repeated. Gameplay trace equality alone does not close that image-evidence task.

AArch64 has cross-build and initialization evidence; hardware gameplay remains
to be exercised. Replay tests ran muted, so audio output needs its own checks.
Web work is deferred and lives in the separate `th08-web` repository.

## Session and resource rules

Start at [the documentation index](README.md#agent-session-route), check
`git status`, and run the status command above. Before reconstruction changes,
follow [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), and
[RE_WORKFLOW.md](RE_WORKFLOW.md).

Use one writable session, one bounded task, and serial captures/builds.
Preserve tested binaries and their provenance before cold builds clear link
outputs. Keep completed metadata, comparison reports, and compressed traces;
remove owned temporary runtimes and compiler trees after their checks finish.
A changed executable, observer, schema, assets, or playback profile requires a
new replay output directory.

## Next bounded work

The native spell-background owner repair is prepared on
`fix/native-spell-background-owner`, based on main checkpoint `4fe9ce61`.
Canonical target observations show seven writes and one read at
`Background + 0xB34 = 0x004E4B64`. Source and relocation entries now select
that shared field. All three affected units and the full 1,106-unit cold
comparison pass. Fresh normal and bugfix links pass the seven-write/one-read
owner guard and the existing linked-data/callee checks.

The independent worktree exposed VC7 anonymous-namespace names that change
with source paths. The comparator now preserves complete decorated signatures
while normalizing only the generated namespace discriminator; ambiguous
matches are rejected. Both this worktree and the portable source checkpoint
pass cold comparisons. A controlled two-path compiler probe confirms identical
source and function bytes with different discriminators. Native replay and
Final A image checks for these newly linked products remain pending before
publication. Keep these products distinct from the earlier published binaries.

For runtime work, select a concrete remaining visual or hardware scenario and
retain the stage, route, recording, frame, and comparison evidence. For exact
reconstruction, resume the authored near match or one bounded whole-link/library
dependency. The ANM semantic queue keeps opcodes 25, 31, and 88 neutral until
complete TH08 consumer evidence supports a shared-layout rename.

The completed human/agent documentation batch and earlier repair investigations
are retained in the [handoff archive](RE_HANDOFF_HISTORY.md#native-replay-handoff--2026-10-11).
